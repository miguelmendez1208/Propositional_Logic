This took a while but not that long either.
18685. LowTemp NoLeakH2 ReactorUnitSafe V1 V2 ~NoLeak ~NoLeakH1 ~okH1 ~okH2 {18281, 11499}
18686. NoLeak NoLeakH1 NoLeakH2 ReactorUnitSafe V2 l okH1 ~LowTemp ~V1 {18415, 15077}
Not Valid

I believe this code is a significant improvement to the two previous iterations.
